# YellowSnow

See where your fellow developers have left their mark.

## Introduction

This is a simple Flutter application that shows a file's version control history (blame, annotation) using colour gradient.

## User Interface

Opening a text file within a VCS shows each line highlighted according to how recently it has been edited.

On the right-hand side is a map of the entire file.

Along the bottom there is a slider for moving back though the timeline and looking at previous versions of the file.

There is also a dark colour scheme (Purple Stain)
